					In this section, you will find a compilation of resources available for free online that will help you learn how to code.
					If you don't find these resources helpful, you can always find your own. Google is your best friend.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are an absolute beginner, it is recommended that you start with the language called 'java'.
					This is the language used in the AP Computer Science curriculum, so most students will know and be coding in this language.
					Also, it is arguably easier to learn than some other languages.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are plenty of other languages that you can explore, but keep in mind that most of the projects will be coded in 'java'.
					Also remember that no language is king, they all have their flaws and advantages. 
					All languages use the same core programming principles, so no matter which one you choose you will be learning essentially the same skill.

					This website is currently being hosted on a 7 year old PC sitting in Ryan Marren's living room, not by a webhosting service. 
					Therefore, you can expect this site to be down a lot. Also, we can't have a nice '.com' domain name. Sorry about that, hopefully we can solve this problem in the future.
