					Welcome to the Tappan Zee High School Programming Club, a brand new club for the 2013-2014 school year.
					Our goal is to bring together students with an interest in learning more about computer programming and help to organize collaborative on coding projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					We assume that many of you have taken or are taking the programming courses offered in our school. 
					While it is great if you have and we do recommend these courses to anyone interested in programming, they are not required at all to be a member of this club. 
					We are open to anybody who wants to learn or practice programming, even those with no experience at all. 
					In the 'learn' tab in the navigation bar you will find a plethora of resources that will teach you how to code in various languages, and how to use programming tools such as git.

					This website is currently being hosted on a 7 year old PC sitting in Ryan Marren's living room, not by a webhosting service. 
					Therefore, you can expect this site to be down a lot. Also, we can't have a nice '.com' domain name. Sorry about that, hopefully we can solve this problem in the future.
